# Rock-paper-scissors game

Created from scratch as a beginners project to practice Golang.

## Current state
Works in terminal (at least on Win10, have not tested other OS').

A player can play against either the machine or another player.

Against the machine, a scoreboard will track wins, losses, and draws and keep historical data until scoreboard is reset.
